Let's think about the data we will need to expose in order to build our app. Our app needs to:

    - Fetch all upcoming rocket launches
    - Fetch a specific launch by its ID
    - Login the user
    - Book launch trips if the user is logged in
    - Cancel launch trips if the user is logged in


Space-X v2 REST API: (start > server > src > datasource > launch.js)
    - $ npm install apollo-datasource-rest --save
    - package exposes the RESTDataSource class that is responsible for fetching data from a REST API
    - to build a data source for a REST API, extend the RESTDataSource class and define this.baseURL
    - Apollo RESTDataSource also sets up an in-memory cache that caches responses from our REST resources w/ no addtl set up --> "partial query caching"
